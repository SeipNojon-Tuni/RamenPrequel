<dialog>The leader hut should be somewhere in the main town

<dialog>That is a great idea, but why the everyone seems 
to be so scared here</dialog>"

9: {

<dialog>That is a good guestion indeed, but we should not care 
about it and just find the leader, let's go!</dialog>"

<dialog>Anyway, a day ago, a lumpy Spurff servant accidentally 
dropped the most valuable treasure of our planet: 
The Diamond Eye. Our leader declared a state of 
emergency and since then, no one has not 
been allowed to enter or exit the SpurffVille</dialog>"

<dialog>Another Diamond Eye is on the ancient temple, but it is 
too dangerous to go there and there are no volunteers</dialog>"
},
17: {
"links": {
0: 18
},
"text": "<speaker>O'Beep</speaker>
<dialog>That explains why everyone is so scared... 
I just got an great idea! Perhaps we could get the 
Eye from the temple as we have to enter the town 
and see the leader</dialog>"
},
18: {

<dialog>Let's not do that... Althought, now after thinking more. 
We can do that as we can not otherwise progress in 
our journey</dialog>"

<dialog>You Rusty TinHeads want to help us? It is okay
 until you return the new Eye to me.
 (If they fail, we gets robots parts). 
The temple is just behind that corner</dialog>"

<dialog>You can not often simply walk into the temple</dialog>"

6: {
"links": {

<dialog>Anyway, temples often have mechanism that have to 
be opened in someway... Let me see</dialog>"

<dialog>TinHeart, look. These wheels on the door move</dialog>"

<dialog>Be careful O'beep, doing something wrong might cause 
a trap to trigger</dialog>"

"text": "<speaker>TinHeart</speaker>
<dialog>Although now after thinking, those wheels might be 
our solution to getting The Diamond Eye</dialog>"
},
10: {
"links": {
0: 11
},
"text": "<speaker>TinHeart</speaker>
<dialog>We should first look around to see if we find 
some instructions to open the door</dialog>"
},
11: {

},
"text": "<speaker>O'Beep</speaker>
<dialog>Wait, what are these weird symbols next to the door</dialog>"

<dialog>Let me see hmmm...</dialog>"
},
13: {
"links": {
0: 14
},
"text": "<speaker>TinHeart</speaker>
<dialog>Those symbols seems to match ones on the wheel. 
This must be the solution to opening the door.
Great job O'Beep</dialog>"

<dialog>But what should we exaxtly do with these symbols. 
Just try random things?</dialog>"
},
16: {
"links": {
0: 17
},
"text": "<speaker>TinHeart</speaker>
<dialog>That is not helpful. There has to be some pattern. 
Let's try to figure it out!</dialog>"
