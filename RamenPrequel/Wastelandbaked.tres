The only problem is, that the ship seems to be broken and
 we can not get inside of it</dialog>

<dialog>It is definely missing some parts. It seems 
to be missing:  battery, cables, catalytic converter, 
gas bottle, metal plate, rocket fuel and space drive.
Maybe we should head to the wasteland and 
see if we find them</dialog>
